# FDF (Fils de Fer) - Isometric Projections Wireframe

Welcome to the FDF (Fils de Fer) project! This project aims to represent a map in isometric projections wireframe. It provides various controls to manipulate the map, including moving, zooming, changing z-depth, rotation, and wire color.

## Controls

Here are the controls available in the FDF project:

- Move: Use the keys `q`, `w`, `a`, and `d` to move the map.
- Zoom: Use the `^` and `v` keys to zoom in and out.
- Angle: Use the `<` and `>` keys to change the angle of the map.
- Depth: Use the `page up` and `page down` keys to increase or decrease the depth of the map.
- Color: Press the `c` key to change the wire color.
- Projection: Press the `p` key to toggle between different projections.


## Getting Started

To get started with the FDF project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies: `make`, `clang`, `X11`
2. Build the project: `make`
3. Run the project: `./fdf test_maps/42.fdf`
